Hi $name,

The Student Robotics competition is getting ever closer (less than 7
weeks!) -- to attend the competition, we require students to return a
media consent form to us (as mentioned in a previous email). Entrance
for competitors is ticketed, and they won't receive a ticket until the
consent form is returned.

The overview of how this works is thus: the competitors visit our
website and receive a media consent form, that's then signed by
themselves / a parent/guardian, and returned to you. You then post them
to us (using the address below). We process the form, and email the
student with details on how to get their ticket (it's a PDF with a QR
code that they need to bring with them on the day).

To make this all easier, we've generated a web page that'll produce a
consent form with most of the data filled in, and a QR code to ease our
processing of the form. This is located at:

  https://www.studentrobotics.org/mediaconsent

It requires the competitor to have an account on the website already --
which they should have. An account is mandatory for receiving a ticket
too. See my earlier emails for details about generating accounts for
competitors. You can correct any student details on the user management
page too, in case they're wrong.

There's also another media consent form with no fields filled in
attached (which will also appear in the 'team-leaders' section of the
website tomorrow). If there are any non-competitors attending (other
teachers, parents, interested parties etc) they should fill the form in
and bring it to the competition. While competitors can fill this form
in too, we'd greatly appreciate it if they use the website generated one.

Hi XYZ,

Thank you for registering interest in Student Robotics 2014! This year
we have 54 places to offer teams, and one of them is now reserved for
you. At this point in time, we're not yet able to confirm the place --
it depends on you returning a signed team leader agreement, which we're
currently putting the finishing touches on. More news on this in the next
couple of days.

To take part in Student Robotics, you'll need three things:
  1) A team of 16-18 year old students
  2) A team leader (yourself) [0]
  3) Enthusiasm!
This means that you need to recruit a team of competitors to take part
in the competition. We generally find that the optimal team size is six
people, although we've had successful teams taking part in the past with
anywhere between three and ten competitors.

There are two important dates in the Student Robotics year -- these are
KickStart [1] and the Competition [2]. The first is an introduction to
Student Robotics, a chance to meet other teams who are taking part, and
the point where we distribute the electronics kit [3] that you'll be
working with. The date for KickStart is 12/10/13, and will be occurring
in Southampton, Bristol, and Norfolk -- for more details, see the 'key
dates' portion of our website.

The competition happens at the end of the Student Robotics year, and is
a two day event where your robot will compete against other teams'
robots. Here's a video [4] of the SR2013 final, which gives an idea of
the atmosphere to expect. The preliminary date is the weekend of the
19/20th of April 2014, although this and the venue have yet to be
confirmed. The game that will be played in the competition will be
revealed at KickStart.

We'll contact you again in the next few days with more details on
Kickstart, and the aforementioned team-leader agreement: this will set 
out exactly what Student Robotics provides, what we expect from you as 
a team leader, and risk assessments for the Student Robotics year.

Thanks, and we hope to see you at KickStart SR2014! If you have any
inquires do email me at jmorse@studentrobotics.org, or if urgent phone
me on 07837210332.

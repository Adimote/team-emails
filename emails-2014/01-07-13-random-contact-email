Here's a sample of the emails I've been sending out at existing SR contacts
who didn't compete this year. They all follow this form, some with
modifications, with and without extra information, blah blah blah.

X and Y are names.

Hi X,

I represent a student volunteering group, Student Robotics [0], who run
an engineering / education orientated robotics competition for 6th
formers. I believe one of our volunteers (Y) has already
contacted you, but briefly we provide teams of 6th formers an
electronics kit, software and programming support, and a small budget to
build a robot to do a task. This culminates into a 2-day competition
where they test their robots against other teams -- one of the
highlights of which is here [1].

Registration is now open for for next years competition, SR2014. If
you'd like to take part, please see our entrance page [2]. We're hoping
to have 54 teams of 6th formers competing, making it our biggest and
best competition to date.

If you have any questions at all, please do ask!

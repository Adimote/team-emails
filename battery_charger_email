Hello,

We are finally approaching a point at which we will be able ship kit to teams, however before we do so we need to discover which teams already have battery chargers from previous years.

The battery chargers are re-usable from one year to the next and most teams have kept their chargers from previous competitions. We do not want to send out chargers to teams who already have them as this is a waste of money and resources. If you do not already have a battery charger from a previous year could you please reply to this email as soon as possible so that we can include one in the kit shipped to you. We will assume that if you do not reply to this email you already have a charger and you will not receive one with the rest of the kit. The battery chargers look similar to the one pictured here[1] (it may not have the 4 red LEDs as shown in that photo).

Please note that this year we have requested that the battery charger should be returned along with the other items of kit listed in appendix A.1 of the rules.

Regards,
Richard Barlow
SR Vice President

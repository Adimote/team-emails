\author{Revision 1}
\date{\today}

\begin {document}
\maketitle

This is an agreement between the organisers of the Student Robotics
competition, and you the ``Team leader'' in charge of a team taking part
in the Student Robotics competition. The organisers of Student Robotics are
the current members of the committee, namely Sophia Maria, Rich Barlow,
Sam Phippen, Andy Cottrell, Jeremy Morse, and Rob Spanton.
\paragraph{}
\textbf{Responsibilities of Student Robotics.}

The organisers will:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide an electronics kit (``The Kit'') on loan along with software
tools, documentation and support for teams.

\item Replace parts of the electronics kit that become damaged, depending
on the cause of the damage.

\item Provide website accounts to competitors for our forums and IDE. To
maintain these accounts, we store the following pieces of data:
\begin{itemize}
\item First name,
\item Last name,
\item Contact email address,
\item Team/School
\end{itemize}
We will not share any of this information with third parties, except when
printing participation certificates, when we will send a list of names to
our printers. The email address will only be used to send (infrequent) bulk
organization email to students, although in exceptional circumstances we
may email the student directly regarding something they've done on the
website.

\item Organise the Kickstart event at which the robot task (``The game'') will
be announced and kit distributed to teams. Kickstart also includes an
introduction to the software and hardware.

\item Organise support sessions (``Tech Days'') at various locations through
the build period.

\item Organise the competition weekend at the end of the build period.

\item Provide suitable risk assessments in advance for all events.

\item Provide relevant safety information in the use of the kit, particularly
the batteries.

\item Endeavor to provide 'in person' mentoring for teams, subject to
availability and location of volunteers.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{}
\textbf{Responsibilities of Team Leaders.}

Team leaders will:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Arrange parental consent and provide suitable adult supervision at
events.

\item Provide competitor information (described above) via an online form for
account creation.

\item Ensure competitor safety during the build period, such as in the use of
tools and the kit.

\item Arrange transportation, accommodation and meals at events (Note that
the competition lasts two days).

\item Ensure kit is treated carefully to minimise the risk of damage.

\item Ensure kit is returned at the competition or arrange a later return
date in advance.  If kit is kept after the competition, team leaders must
arrange the return at their own expense, including registered delivery with
minimum \textsterling500 insurance.

\item Arrange for signed media consent forms for competitors to be returned
to Student Robotics.
\end{enumerate}

Subject: Student Robotics: organisation and site details

Hi,

As mentioned in my previous email, your place in the Student Robotics
competition has been confirmed, and the date for Kickstart has been
pushed back to the 25th of October. This email has more organisational
information for preparing for Kickstart.

Please find attached an introduction to Student Robotics and
terms-of-service document, "tos.pdf". If you haven't participated in
Student Robotics before, this explains some of our terminology and what
we provide for the team, as well as what we require from you, the team
leader. If you've participated in a previous competition, please still
read the "What we require from you" section of the document to ensure
you haven't missed anything.

Please also find attached a *draft* disclaimer for participation in the
competition. This is not yet in it's final form and we'll be issuing a
revised version shortly prior to Kickstart, which we will require you to
sign when you receive the electronics kit.

Tomorrow we'll be generating website accounts for you and emailing you
the details, which you can use to register competitors for the
competition. Documentation on how to do this is at the bottom of this
page [0].

Finally, we've now uploaded the particulars for the Southampton
Kickstart, which can be found here [1], including parking arrangements
and the day schedule. I've had a couple of enquiries about whether teams
can attend London instead. Unfortunately we have an attendee limit
there, and have already exhausted the number of teams that the site can
accommodate. To be clear, we currently expect you to visit the
Southampton Kickstart.

Finally, we've now uploaded the particulars for the London Kickstart,
which can be found here [1], including parking arrangements and the day
schedule. Due to the unique location, we'll be requiring three things
from you:
 1) An estimate of how many competitors will be attending
 2) The team will need to bring a laptop to Kickstart
 3) To use the on-site car park, you'll need to provide the license
    plate number of the vehicle in advance

We'll get in contact about how many competitors you'll be bringing once
you've had a chance to recruit a team -- if you know already, please
let me know by reply email.

Thanks you for taking part in Student Robotics, we wish you the best of
luck in recruiting competitors, and look forwards to seeing you and the
team on the 25th of October!

Subject: Student Robotics: MCF reminder

Hi {first_name},

This is a reminder that we require media consent forms to be return for each
competitor attending the competition. Competitors are only allowed entry to 
the competition if they have a ticket, which they obtain by returning a
consent form.

We're about to directly mail all competitors about this, so you may receive
some immediate feedback about consent forms. The summary of who needs a
consent form and how to obtain one are copied below.

~

Entrance to the competition for competitors is ticketed: we require
signed media consent forms to be returned (in advance) for each
attending competitor. After we receive those, a printable ticket will
become available, that competitors will need to bring with them.
Everyone else, including teachers, parents, and other interested parties
are welcome to attend, although they'll need to either bring a media
consent form with them or sign one at the door. Non-competitor attendees
under the age of 18 will need a parent/guardian in attendance too.

To return a media consent form, competitors and team leaders should access
the following URL:

  https://www.studentrobotics.org/mediaconsent

Which will serve them a media consent form with their details written
into it. They should print out a copy, have their parent/guardian fill out
the missing parts as appropriate, and return it to you the team leader. Once
you've collected all media consent forms, please scan them and email copies
to mediaconsent@studentrobotics.org.

Scans must be of print-quality please, photographing the form is insufficient.
Given postal delays in previous years we would prefer email delivery of all
consent forms, however we can receive post if needs be (please email in
advance to get the correct postal address).

Once we've processed a form, the competitor will receive an email linking them
to the ticket download page.

Thanks,
Jeremy

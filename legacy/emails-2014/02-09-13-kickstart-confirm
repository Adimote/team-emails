Hi,

You've received this email because you expressed interest in taking part
in Student Robotics 2014 -- thank you! We're now in a position to
confirm that the Kickstart event will happen on the 12th of October, 2013.

We're also happy to say that (due to the quantity of teams) Kickstart
will be happening in multiple places -- currently Southampton and
Bristol, and possibly Norfolk (to be confirmed). We'll be working out
who's attending which Kickstart shortly.

In the meantime there are a number of things happening -- we're
currently finalising the team-leader agreement and posters, more details
on those soon. We also hope you're considering how to recruit students
and get them involved in your team.

Finally, if for any reason you're no longer able to take part in Student
Robotics, please let us know -- it isn't a problem at all, and we'll be
able to offer the place to other teams.

We're all looking forwards to seeing you at the Kickstart event!

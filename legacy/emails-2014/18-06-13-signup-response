Hi XYZ,

Thank you for registering interest in Student Robotics 2014! This year
we're hoping to be able to offer 54 teams a place in the competition,
although this depends on funding and manufacturing matters. At this
point in time we're not in a position to confirm your place, although we
will definitely offer you a place when we're able.

To take part in Student Robotics, you'll need three things:
  1) A team of 16-18 year old students
  2) A team leader (yourself) [0]
  3) Enthusiasm!
This means that you need to recruit a team of competitors to take part
in the competition. We generally find that the optimal team size is six
people, although we've had successful teams taking part in the past with
anywhere between three and ten competitors.

There are two important dates in the Student Robotics year -- these are
KickStart [1] and the Competition [2]. The first is an introduction to
Student Robotics, a chance to meet other teams who are taking part, and
the point where we distribute the electronics kit [3] that you'll be
working with. The date for KickStart is penciled in as 12/10/13 -- this
has yet to be confirmed, but is very likely to be in October in all cases.

The competition happens at the end of the Student Robotics year, and is
a two day event where your robot will compete against other teams'
robots. Here's a video [4] of the SR2013 final, which gives an idea of
the atmosphere to expect. The preliminary date is the weekend of the
19/20th of April 2014, although this and the venue have yet to be
confirmed. The game that will be played in the competition will be
revealed at KickStart.

We'll contact you again before the start of the 2014 academic year,
hopefully with an offer of a place. The place will be subject to you
signing a team-leader agreement: this will set out exactly what Student
Robotics provides, what we expect from you as a team leader, and risk
assessments for the Student Robotics year.

Thanks, and we hope to see you at KickStart SR2014! If you have any
inquires do email me at jmorse@studentrobotics.org, or if urgent phone
me on XXXXXXXXXX.

Subject: Student Robotics 2015: Final competition details

Hi,

The Student Robotics competition is now less than one week away! We hope
you're looking forwards to it as much as we are! Please remember that
you need a ticket to attend, and to get one you need to have returned a
media consent form to your teacher. (Any further form returns from this
date will need to be via scan-in and email).

We've also uploaded a map of where your team will be at the venue [0].

In the course of the competition, you'll probably want to modify
something on your robot (to improve it, or repair it). You should bring
tools with you to the competition, and you should ensure someone in your
team is bringing a laptop so that you can alter your robot's code.

Please re-read the rulebook and make sure that you comply with all the
rules and regulations [1], particularly the safety rules (appendix B)
and the Robot Badge mounts. If your robot does not comply with these
rules or we judge it unsafe, you will not be able to compete until it
does! In particular, you MUST have some kind of rigid compartment that
protects your battery from collisions and sharp objects.

Finally, you should bring _all_ of the robotics kit to the competition,
as we will be collecting it at the end. A list of all the parts is in
appendix A of the rulebook [1]. Please also have your batteries and
charger ready when you arrive: we'll be collecting these and performing
battery charging ourselves.

Good luck, and may the best robot win!

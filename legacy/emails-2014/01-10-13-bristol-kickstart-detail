Hello,

Welcome to Student Robotics Bristol!

George (CC'd) and I will be schools liaison for the Bristol branch of Student Robotics for the coming year.

Firstly I would like to announce the time table for the Kickstart event on the 12th October 2013.

* **10:45** - Arrival 
* **11:00** - Welcome talk 
* **11:10** - Introduction to the kit, game 
* **11:40** - Kit introductory tasks - morning session 
* **13:00** - Lunch 
* **14:00** - Kit introductory tasks - afternoon session 
* **17:30** - Finished 

Sadly the university is still being slow in confirming our rooms bookings, but we are working on this as much as we can.
However, it seems very unlikely that we will not have the Merchant Venturers Building for the 12th.
Therefore please assume the timetable above to be correct.

I would like to announce the provisional dates for the Bristol tech days:

Tech Day 1 - 14th Dec 2013 or 30th Nov 2013

Tech Day 2 - 8th Feb 2014

Tech Day 3 - 8th Mar 2014

As I said these dates are provisional but other than Tech Day 1 we don't expect them to change.
I will send out an email as soon as we have confirmed Tech Day 1 so you can firmly place it in your diaries.

Finally,

A risk assessment form is complete but requires signing off. This will be done in the next couple of days and so I will send out a copy of the form as soon as that has been completed.

Many thanks once again for signing up to Student Robotics 2013/2014, please don't hesitate to ask me any questions you may have.

Kind Regards,

Joe Hacker
Student Robotics Bristol

Hi,

I hope your Student Robotics teams are still enthused and making
progress ahead of the competition -- please remember that we will be
needing media consent forms returned for all the competitors intending
to attend the competition, which will become difficult during the Easter
break. Thanks to those who have already returned consent forms; further
forms can be returned via a mentor or by mailing them to the address below.

I'd also like to remind you that the Student Robotics kit is on loan,
and we'll be expecting to collect it from the teams at the end of
competition. We often find that schools wish to keep the kit for longer,
so that they can demonstrate their robots in school or show it off at
other events. If you'd like to keep the kit beyond the end of the
competition, please inform info@studentrobotics.org no later than the
30th of March.

You may also recall that there's a Â£75 budget for parts provided by SR
to all teams. To reclaim this budget, please email
treasurer@studentrobotics.org stating how much you wish to reclaim and
which teams the reclaim is for. You'll need to bring receipts and
invoices for the reclaimed amount to the competition, where we'll hand
you a cheque. You can reclaim budget after the competition too, but we'd
appreciate you doing it ASAP, certainly before the summer holidays.

Finally, if you have any queries about any issues related to the
competition and need an urgent answer, my phone number is xxxxxxxxxxx.

Hi,

With the competition less than a week away we want to remind you about
some of the things you should bring/prepare for the competition:

 * Your ticket.
 * Your robot.
 * Ensure your robot has robot badge mountings with hook type velcro,
   see [1c].
 * Re-read the rulebook to make sure your robot complies, especially
   with the safety regulations [1b].
 * Laptops, tools, anything else to successfully work with your robot.
 * Receipts for expenses that you will be claiming against your Student
   Robotics budget [2].
 * All batteries and the chargers you received from Student Robotics.

We will collect batteries and chargers at the beginning of the
competition and provide you with charged batteries throughout the
competition.

All other parts of the kit you received from Student Robotics that need
to be returned [1a] -- you must return these at the end of the
competition, unless you have arranged to keep the kit. Prepare your kit
in the kit box after the competition, check again if you packed
everything from [1a]. (You don't have to return the mechanical kit).

Check out [3] for information on the schedule, parking and food. With
the increased number of participants, consider bringing your own
sandwiches, since they will probably sell out fast in the nearby stores.

The Student Robotics Blueshirts hope you have a great  competition, and
may the best robot win!

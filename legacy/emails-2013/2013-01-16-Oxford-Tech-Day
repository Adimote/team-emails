Hi,

The first Oxford Tech Day is coming up on the 23rd February [0]. It will be held
at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy [1], home to the JET and MAST fusion
experiments - as such, it'll be a little different. Participating teams should
make significant progress on their robots and will benefit from having a number
of blueshirts on hand, but there'll also be a short talk on nuclear fusion, a
tour of JET (~ 1 hour), and possibly a demonstration by our Remote Handling
group (~ 30 minutes).

Please bring tools and equipment for hacking on your robot (this includes
laptops - WiFi will be available but we can't provide computers for this event);
note that a responsible adult must be present if you want to use any dangerous
tools. You're likely to get the most out of this day if the robot is past the
"base on wheels" stage.

RSVP if you intend to come (with a rough estimate of how many people you will
bring) - I can send further details closer to the event, and we'll need to
arrange temporary site passes. Note that our site is a few miles from the
nearest town and our canteen shuts on weekends, so participants need to bring a
packed lunch (or money for a pizza order).

Note that this is one of a number of tech days in three locations this year,
more details can be found here [2].

Thanks,
Andy (SR Blueshirt and CCFE Engineer)

Hi,

The nth Student Robotics tech day [0] is coming up; we highly
recommend attending a tech day to get advice from a wide range of
blueshirts and to see what other teams are doing. Please bring tools and
equipment for hacking on your robot; note that a responsible adulb must
be present if you want to use any dangerous tools.

We're currently running tech days in three locations, please RSVP if you
know you'll be coming. Below are relevant pages for your area:

Southampton: <date> <event-page-link>

Bristol: <date> <event-page-link>

Oxford: <date> <event-page-link>

We'd be more than happy for teams from further afield to attend any of
these tech days.

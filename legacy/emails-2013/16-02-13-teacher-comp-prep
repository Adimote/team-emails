Hi,

The Student Robotics 2013 competition marches ever closer! This year the
competition is over the weekend of the 13th and 14th of April, and is
located at the University of Southampton's Highfield campus in the
Students Union building. A preliminary schedule for the two days is
below. We expect teams to attend for all the competition rounds.

Note that while we take care of all competition related matters, we
can't make arrangements for anything outside of it. This means you must
arrange transport to, from, and if necessary accommodation in
Southampton for the duration of the competition yourselves, as well as
feeding yourselves.

We've had a couple of inquiries from teams about making a group booking
at a hotel, to negotiate a lower cost. If you haven't yet made
arrangements and would like to take part in this, please let met know
what your requirements are (i.e. number of attendees, rooms required,
additional constraints) and I'll put you in touch with other interested
teams. To get everything done in good time, please reply within a week
if you're interested in this.

Finally, we require media consent forms from all competitors attending
the competition, which will be enforced by ticketed entrance for the
competitors (more on this later). In approximately a day we'll be
mailing all users with a link to the form [0], with instructions to have
a parent/guardian fill it in and return it to you, the team leader. Once
you've collected your competitors consent forms, please either return
them to your blueshirt mentor, a blueshirt at a Tech Day, or mail them
to the address below.

Teachers, parents, relatives and other hangers on can also attend the
competition without a ticket, but will need to a) be obviously over 18
or have an attending parent, and b) fill out a media consent form on
arrival. Consent forms for competitors is fully mandatory; if you're
unable to get the forms to us in time for the competition, please
contact us rather than bringing competitors without tickets.

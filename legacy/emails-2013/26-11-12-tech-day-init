Hi,

The Student Robotics year is now under way! The rules, forums, and IDE
are now live. If you encounter any problem with them, do report it via
the forums or email info@.

We're also now able to send out mentors to teams. If you're located near
Bristol, you should already have been allocated a mentor; otherwise
please reply with the time that your team meets (if there's a regular
meeting), and we'll try and arrange a blueshirt to visit you.

If you're a significant distance from either Bristol or Southampton, we
still might be able to arrange a mentor for you. Many engineering firms
run outreach schemes and have successfully sent engineers to mentor SR
teams in the past.

We're also now running our tech days; those around Bristol should have
received the details on this day in an email yesterday.

The Southampton tech day will be on the 1st of December, and will be on
Southampton University campus. Parking will be available on campus, with
arrivals from 9am. There is no fixed schedule for the day,although we'll
stop for lunch at noon. You can bring your own lunch,visit one of the
nearby convenience stores, or eat at the students unioncafe, which
serves hot food and is on campus. The day will finish at 5pm, although
there's no need to stay for the whole period.

We're also still looking at organizing tech days around Oxford: we've
identified a couple of locations, but haven't yet finalized any
bookings. It's likely we'll end up holding one in February and one in
March, if everything goes well.

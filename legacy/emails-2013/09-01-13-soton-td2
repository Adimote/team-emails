Hi,

The second Student Robotics Southampton tech day [0] is coming up on the
9th of February; we highly recommend attending a tech day to get advice
from a wide range of blueshirts and to see what other teams are doing.
Please bring tools and equipment for hacking on your robot; note that a
responsible adult must be present if you want to use any dangerous tools.

We're currently running tech days in three locations [1] (with Oxford
soon to be confirmed), but the nearest one to you is in Southampton,
with full details on the website [2].

Please RSVP to alynn@[srobo] if you know you'll be coming.

We're more than happy for any teams to attend tech days further afield,
just contact us for details.

Hi,

Thank you for participating in Student Robotics 2013. We hope you
enjoyed it as much as we did. We would very much like to hear about your
experience. It would help us out a lot if you could spend a minute or
two to fill out a short online survey about that experience.  Please
click the following link to start the survey:

If you have any photos or videos from the competition, be sure to share
them with us   We have a flickr group that you can add your photos to
[0], and it'd be wonderful if you could tweet at us (@StudentRobotics)
about any videos that you've uploaded.

Thanks again! We hope to see you again in SR2014!

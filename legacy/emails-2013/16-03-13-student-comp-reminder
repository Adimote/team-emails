Hi,

The 2013 Student Robotics competition is approaching fast! Please
remember that you need a ticket to attend the competition, which you'll
be able to download from [0] using your Student Robotics website
account, once you've returned a signed media consent form [1] to attend
the competition.

If you can't log in, please contact your teacher first, otherwise email
info@studentrobotics.org for help.

At the competition itself you'll probably want to spend a lot of time
tinkering with your robot and tweaking your code. That will require the
use of a computer, and unfortunately we're not able to provide computing
facilities for all of you. Please arrange for at least one of your team
to bring a laptop or other computer for you to program your robot on
[2]. Internet will be provided! If no-one in your team is able to bring
a laptop, please contact info@studentrobotics.org and we may be able to
arrange something for you.

Finally, we've cooked up a tool to help you test your robot with. The
manual control interface [3] is a robot.zip that you can load onto your
robot in the usual manner [4], and which will give you a graphical
interface for controlling components of your robot. We hope this will
help you accelerate your robot testing!

[2] Bringing more than one computer would be wise; teams have in the
past left chargers and other vital parts at home.

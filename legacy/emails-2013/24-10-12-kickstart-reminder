Hi,

You've received this email because you've registered for Student
Robotics 2013!

Your place in the SR2013 competition is confirmed, and we're looking
forward to seeing you on the 3rd of November. Please see our previous
emails for more specific details on Kickstart [0].

In the meantime we've produced an introduction to python, the
programming language used to program the robots, in case you want to get
cracking immediately [1].

We'd also like to remind you that you'll need to collect your
electronics kit at Kickstart, which will be in an 18l 50x30x20cm "Really
useful box". We're also providing four 2m long aluminium L-sections to
aid mechanical support in your robot.

If you won't be able to collect your kit at Kickstart please do let us
know so that we can make alternative arrangements. Unfortunately we can
no longer afford to ship the kit to teams who can't attend; instead
we'll provide details for you to arrange a courier to collect it.

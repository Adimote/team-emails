Hi,

The email content below has just been sent at competitors, to encourage
them to remember what to bring to the competition. In case you have any
urgent inquiries, or have trouble getting to the competition, my mobile
number is xxxxxxxxxxx.

We're expecting three categories of competitors to arrive:

1) Those who have returned media consent forms and have printed a
ticket. They'll be able to go straight into the competition.

2) Those who have returned a media consent form but forgotten their
ticket. This isn't a problem, we'll allow them in at the door if you'll
confirm their identity for us.

3) Competitors who have arranged to return Media Consent forms on the
day -- we have a list of names of people who have arranged (or you have
arranged) to return their consent form on the day. If you have someone
with a form but who hasn't arranged this, please phone me ASAP!

We're not expecting any other category of competitor (i.e., people who
don't have consent forms, or haven't arranged in advance). We reserve
the right to refuse entry!

(A number of you have asked about visitors / parents / yourselves --
anyone who's not a competitor (and obviously over 18) will be able to
sign a consent form when you arrive at the competition, if you haven't
returned one already).

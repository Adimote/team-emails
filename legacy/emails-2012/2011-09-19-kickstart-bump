Hi,

The Student Robotics KickStart event is fast approaching, more details are now available on our news pages [0]. We hope you're having success in attracting attention and potential team members.

We'd appreciate it if you could reply to this email by 5pm Wednesday indicating whether you'll be able to attend KickStart, and if so have a rough estimate of how many students may come.

At some point during the KickStart day, we'll be holding a discussion session with teachers so that we can better understand our relationship with you.

As ever, if you have any questions, please do mail me.

Hello Bristol Schools,

This is just a quick reminder that the final tech day before the competition will be on the 10th of March 2012 in the Merchant Venturers' Building on Woodland Road (http://g.co/maps/euj8x), running from 10:00AM to 5:00PM. Please note that you will need to bring your own tools for working on your robot and anyone using power tools will need a responsible supervising adult. Also, whilst you'll all have access to the university's computers, you'll doubtless have files and settings on your own laptops which won't be available there, so we recommend you bring those with you too. Once again there will be tokens, buckets and arena markers available for you to use for testing, several blueshirts around to help with various issues, and another opportunity for you to present your robot to the other schools in our lightning talks.

Hope to see you all there,
Tim Jones

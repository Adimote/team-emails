Hi,

Student Robotics is now entering the main portion of the year, where
students are developing and testing their robots. There are a few
"housekeeping" tasks to perform in the meantime, which are:

 - Web accounts.
 - Organizing Mentoring.
 - Tech days.
 - Tickets.

==== Web Accounts ====

To access the IDE and the Student Robotics forum, each competitor (and
teacher) gets an account (username + password). To create these, we need
you to provide a list of student names and email addresses, and (if you
are receiving two kits) a rough idea of which students are in which
teams.

We'll also be generating an account for you the teacher; if there are
other teachers participating at your school, please provide their name
and email, and we'll generate accounts for them too.

The IDE and forum are available at [0] and [1], and will be accessible
once we create accounts for this year. Throughout the year, competitors
and teachers can change their password at [2] or reset it at [3].

====  Mentoring ====

A word from Chris Kirkham (ckirkham@studentrobotics.org, CC'd), who's
organizing mentoring for this year:

Now that the Student Robotics competition is underway, we need to know
when you'll be meeting to work on you robot(s) so that we can start
arranging some mentoring.  The sooner we know, the sooner we can get out
to see how you're getting on!  If you could reply to this email when you
know some days and times, that would be much appreciated.

As you are probably aware, some of the more distant schools and colleges
won't be able to be mentored that frequently (or at all in some cases).
Don't worry, this is not a problem.  We'll be keeping in touch to see
how the robot's doing and how the team is getting on.  If you have any
problems, you can always ask on the forum [1] or send us an email [4].

That's all for now,
Good luck!

==== Tech Days ====

The dates of this years tech days, described here [5], were announced at
KickStart. These were, for Southampton:

    * 3rd December
    * 4th February
    * 17th March

Each on the campus itself. More details such as location and parking
arrangements closer to the event. These dates will appear on our website
shortly. We'll also be uploading a risk assessment for tech days.

The University of Bristol tech days may be on different dates; please
contact Sam Phippen for more details on this.

==== Tickets ====

Each year we ask competitors to return signed media consent forms, so
that we can distribute photographs and video taken at the competition.
This year we've come up with a slightly different way of thinking about
it, with tickets.

We will be issuing tickets (via email and the website) for the
competition, based on the names for which we have media consent forms.
Other guests at the competition will be allowed to complete a form on
the day, but we would encourage any guests to complete and return the
forms in advance.

We would like you to distribute and collect the media consent forms
for the teams as soon as possible --I attach a PDF copy.

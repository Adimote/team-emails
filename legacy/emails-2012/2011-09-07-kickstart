Hi,

You've received this email because you've expressed an interest in
taking part in the Student Robotics competition 2011-2012.

As the new school year starts, so does Student Robotics -- the KickStart
[0] event gives competitors and teachers an introduction to this years
competition and overview of how to build and engineer their robot. We'll
also be shipping the mechanical and electronic equipment at the event.

This year, KickStart is on the 24th of September, and as before will be
held on the University of Southampton campus.

This of course means that you'll need some interested students to attend
KickStart. To help with this, we will ship some posters to your school
to help with raising awareness. We recommend that competing teams
contain four to eight students, but this is not a hard limit -- if you
intend on your team containing more than 8 people, please contact us
first.

If you have any inquiries, please don't hesitate to contact me
(jmorse@studentrobotics.org).

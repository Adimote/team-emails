Hi Everyone,

With less than three weeks left until the competition there are a few important things you need to know and take note of beforehand.

1) The Two Day Competition

The competition will be held as a two day event across Saturday 9th and Sunday 10th of April. The first day is designed to help you perfect and test your robot and make sure it is ready for the competition.  Attendance is optional (but highly recommended).

On both days teams should arrive promptly for a 10am start, with the day concluding at around 5pm. You may wish to find accommodation in Southampton for the Saturday night, unfortunately we are unable to help

Participants should bring a lunch or money to buy some food on campus. There will be tea, coffee and biscuits available during the competition throughout both days

The competition will held with a league stage followed by a knockout tournament. All teams will progress to the knockout stages, the league is used to seed the knockout (and ensures that everyone gets a decent number of games.)

2) Media Release Forms

A Media Release Form is attached to this email, it is essential that you should complete and bring it on Saturday 9th. Without one you may be denied entry to the competition.

If you are UNDER 18 then you should have a parent or guardian sign the form.
If you are OVER 18 you should present the form WITH a form of ID showing Proof of Age.

3) Parking and Location

The competition on both days will be taking place in the Cube, this is shown as building 42 on this map:

Free Parking will be available outside the Nuffield Theatre and in the Pay and Display car park also shown on the map. There will be signs up in and around the car park with directions to the Cube.

See you all there!

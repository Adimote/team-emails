Hi,

With less than a week to go until the Student Robotics competition,
right now you're probably testing and fixing the code that makes your
robot move. At the competition you'll still want to tweak it, and that
means you need some form of computer.

Unfortunately we can't provide a computer for every team attending. If
at all possible we'd like a competitor (or teacher) on your team to
bring a laptop, if you have one. We'll be able to provide power sockets
and a wired network (possibly wireless too) that you can edit and
download your code over.

If no-one on your team can bring a laptop to the competition then we can
arrange a computer for your team to use. However, please inform us in
advance by mailing info@studentrobotics.org about it, so that we know
how many to set up.

If your team arrives without a laptop, and without informing us you need
a computer, we may not be able to help!

Good luck and see you in a week,
The Student Robotics Team

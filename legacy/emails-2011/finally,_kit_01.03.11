Hi Everyone!

The moment you (and we) have been waiting for since September has finally arrived! Today we shipped the first part of your kit which will arrive at your schools tomorrow morning before 10am.

It will allow you to get your robot moving and try out the vision system. You should use the docs to help you get started. They can be found at www.studentrobotics.org/docs. A good place to start is the walkthrough, which will run through the basics of getting code on your robot. If you are having any problems post on the forum with as much information as possible including any code you have been using.

The second part of your kit will contain the Servo and JointIO boards which interface with any electronics you want to add on to your robot will be arriving soon, we hope to ship that to your schools next week before the next Southampton Tech Day.

I'm sure you will all be keen to have a go for the First Movement Award and I expect to see posts on the forums within the first few hours of its arrival with video evidence of movement on You-tube (or other sharing site) as well as your source code in the forum post.

Tech Days
The Tech Day on the 19th March offers a great opportunity to make significant progress with your new kit and get advice on how to make the most of your vision system so do your best to come, it will make the days before the competition easier - and much less stressful! A map of the campus showing where the Tech Day will take place is attached (it is building 25 as was last Tech Day)

As with last time:

    The day will run from 10am to around 4pm, with a break for lunch in-between. You are advised to bring a packed lunch or some money for nearby shops.

    We are unable to provide any tools but you may bring your own to work on your robot.

Good Luck All!

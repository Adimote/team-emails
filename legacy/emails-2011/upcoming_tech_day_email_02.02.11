Hi All,

A quick reminder for Saturday's Tech Day

As you will be be aware there is a Tech Day this Saturday in Southampton, thank you all that replied and are coming, for those that have not, you are still welcome I hope we see you on Saturday. We will be starting at 10am in building 25, which can be found on the attached map. The day is a fantastic chance to get our help on your robot and get a first look at the new kit which will be arriving in the next few weeks as well as learn how to use the IDE and try out some python programming. We will be running a demonstration of the IDE during the day and helping you progress on your robots. No tools will be provided but you may bring your own to work on your robot.

We expect the kit to be shipped in the few weeks with only the cases left to be constructed, although it won't be here for the nearest Tech Day.
The day will run from 10am to around 4pm, with a break for lunch in-between. You are advised to bring a packed lunch or some money for nearby shops.

More information on the Bristol Tech Day is coming soon

look forward to seeing you on Saturday,

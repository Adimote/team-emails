Hello,

As you may have recently heard, we are pleased to welcome a team of six sixth formers from Lyc√©e Mounier, Grenoble, France to this year's Student Robotics Competition.

However, this has presented us with a slight logistical problem - as it is a long way to come, accommodation will be necessary for a couple of nights. The University Accommodation Service can't help us as our group is too small, and quotes from local hotels are almost restrictively expensive.

We were hoping that teams in the Southampton area might be able to host the team during the competition - anything you might be able to offer, from fellow competitors offering a place to stay, to camping out in a school room, will be gratefully received.

Regards,
Andy Busse,
Student Robotics President,

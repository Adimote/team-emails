Hi,


There are a few updates to the competition to let you know about.

*Kit Delay*
First of all unfortunately a situation has arisen delaying the release
of the electronics kit.

We receive a grant from the kind people at the Motorola Foundation each
year to allow us to run the competition and purchase the kit for your
robots. Unfortunately the cheque for the funds for this year's
competition has been lost by our bank in an extremely unlucky turn of
events. We are looking to re-source the grant as quickly as possible and
we should hopefully have the kit ready soon, however because the
situation is out of Student Robotics' control we are unable to provide a
date for the release of kit. We do have funds to allow all other aspects
of the competition to continue.

We apologise for the inconvenience this causes and we hope you are
having more luck with your robots than we are!


*Competition Date*
Following unanimous feedback the competition has been moved to the
weekend of the 9th/10th April, we look forward to seeing you there.

*Tech Days*
The Southampton Tech Days have now been confirmed as the 5th February
and the 19th March at the universities so keep these days free! These
are a chance to come to the university and get help from us to make
significant progress on your robot, especially if you are having
problems. A reminder will be sent out nearer the time as well as more
information on how the day is structured.

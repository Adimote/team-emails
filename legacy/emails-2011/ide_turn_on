Mailed to: All

Hi all,

For the recent Student Robotics tech day (and impending kit shipment),
we've turned the robot IDE on, which you can reach at the following URL:

https://studentrobotics.org/ide

There's also a link to the IDE on the website front page, as well as
links to documentation for how to use the IDE. To log in, use your
Student Robotics username and password, which you should have received
by email after registering at Kickstart.

Please note - code that you write in the IDE cannot yet be used on
robots (and won't until kit reaches you). We're enabling the IDE so that
people can get used to using it, and to iron out any bugs.

Because of this, we will be wiping all code in the IDE and starting
again when the kit goes out - so don't start developing large pieces of
code in there yet, please!

Feel free to give feedback or ask for help on the forums. If you have
trouble logging in, please email accounts@studentrobotics.org

Thanks,
Jeremy

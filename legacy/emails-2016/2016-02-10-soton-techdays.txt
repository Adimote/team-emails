Subject: Student Robotics Tech Days in Southampton

Hi {first_name},

We hope your team is enjoying building their robot and are looking forward to the competition!

We've got two more tech days happening in Southampton. One on the 27th February ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/events/sr2016/2016-02-27-southampton-tech-day-3 ) and another on the 19th March ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/events/sr2016/2016-03-19-southampton-tech-day-4 ). We encourage anyone to come along, it will be a great opportunity to test out your robot and see how the other teams are getting on. We're currently looking into the possibility of setting up a test arena for you on those days and we'll let you know in advance about that.

We look forward to seeing as many of you here as possible. If you are intending on coming to one of our tech days, it would be great if you could notify us in advance, details are available on the event pages or on our contact page ( https://www.studentrobotics.org/about/contactus ).

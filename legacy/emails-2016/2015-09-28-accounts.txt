Hi,

As part of the Student Robotics competition, we run a set of web
services for competitors. Most of these are publicly accessible (for
example, the documentation), however a few of them require accounts on
the website to use. Specifically, the IDE [0] allows competitors to
write code and export it to their robot. The forum [1] allows
competitors to discuss problems they're having, ask for help, and talk
about the competition.

Competitor accounts are created by you, the team leader. In a few
minutes you'll receive an email containing a username and password for
accessing the user management page [2], where you can enter competitor
details for account creation. Existing users can also have their
passwords reset, and can be moved between teams (if you have multiple
teams). Documentation on this process can be found at the bottom of this
page [3], or you can email me with any questions.

Please could you start registering accounts for competitors ASAP so that
we have an idea of how many people are taking part this year. Accounts
can be registered throughout the year, competitors occasionally come and
go. If you're no longer intending on taking part in Student Robotics,
please let me know ASAP.

A word on data protection, we use the account information to:
 * Maintain a register of who is taking part in the competition
 * Maintain the online account (resetting passwords, etc)
 * Contacting competitors if a specific issue related to their
   website account occurs
 * The occasional mass-email encouraging competitors to return
   media consent forms, prepare for the competition, and similar.
for the duration of the competition. We do not share any information
with third parties.

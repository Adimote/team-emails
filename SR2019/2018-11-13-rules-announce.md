Hi all,

It's with great pleasure we're publishing the rulebook for Student Robotics 2019. We announced the game at [kickstart](https://www.studentrobotics.org/2018-11-12-sr2019-rules-released/), and gave you an insight into the rules, but the rulebook formalises and documents them for all to see. This rulebook has some notable changes compared to what was announced at kickstart:

- The height of the volcano is now 75mm

Our game this year is called Caldera in which teams need to claim the most zones by placing more of their tokens than the other robots within the zone boundaries.

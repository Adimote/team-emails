Hi all,

It's with great pleasure we're releasing the rules for Student Robotics 2019. We announced the game at kickstart, and gave you an insight into the rules, but the rulebook formalises and documents them for all to see.

Our game this year is called Caldera in which teams need to claim the most zones by placing more of their tokens than the other robots within the zone boundaries.

[Download the rules](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/)

If you have any questions about the rules, please [post on our forums](https://www.studentrobotics.org/forum/) (which will be live very soon!).

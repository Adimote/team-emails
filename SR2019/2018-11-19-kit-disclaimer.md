Hello there!

As you were unable to attend kickstart, we need to ship you your kit. Before this can happen, we need you to sign a disclaimer. This disclaimer covers the terms and conditions under which you may use the kit and outlines the limits of our responsibilities.

As it's a legal document, please print out and sign the disclaimer form below, and email it back to us. Once we have a release form for you, we'll send out your kit to the address listed below. Please let us know explicitly if this address is correct, and if it's not, let us know an updated one.

Address:

If you have any other questions, please let us know!

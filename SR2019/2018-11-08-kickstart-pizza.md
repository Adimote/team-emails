Hi all,

Thanks to our sponsor, the University of Southampton, we're able to provide pizza for the Southampton kickstart lunch. This means you no longer need to bring your own food, or seek it out from the nearby food vendors.

Lactose intolerant, gluten free, and vegetarian options will be available, and all items are nut-free.

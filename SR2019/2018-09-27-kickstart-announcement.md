It's time to announce the long-awaited return of Student Robotics. We're pleased to inform you that we will be running a competition this year, culminating in a competition around April 2019. As always, we start this competition period with a Kickstart event. Here, we will announce the game, and show you how to use the kit.

Kickstart will be on the **10th November 2018**. This time, we're planning on running 2 events. 1 at the **University of Southampton**, and the second in **London**. The exact locations will be confirmed in the next couple of weeks, however the events will run from around 10am, and finish some time before 5pm. This information will be reflected on our website soon.

If you would like to compete in Student Robotics 2019, please fill in the form at the link below with the required information. All further emails about SR2019 will be sent there. The closing date will be the *1st November*.

subject: Announcing tech days

As was announced at kickstart, we intend to run some tech days over this competition year. Tech days are opportunities for teams to get help if they’re struggling with a technical issue, and is a controlled environment for students to make more progress on their robots. It’s also an opportunity to see how well they’re doing in comparison to other teams.

As with all other events, students *must* be accompanied by a responsible adult.

We will be running tech days at the University of Southampton on the following days:

- 15th December 2018
- 9th February 2019
- 9th March 2019

These tech days will be at the Highfield campus, start around 10am, and finish around 5pm. However please turn up and leave whenever's appropriate.

We would like to also run some tech days in London. If you would be interested in a tech day in London too on these dates, please let us know as soon as possible. For the December tech day, we need enough teams by the 12th to make it happen.

Specific details for tech days will be available on our website soon.

We hope to see many of you there!

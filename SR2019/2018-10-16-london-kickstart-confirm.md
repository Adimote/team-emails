Hello!

We'd like to confirm your place at the London kickstart even for Student Robotics 2019.

Exact details and directions are available on our website: https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2019/london-kickstart/

It is very important that you bring at least 1 laptop for your team. Computers are not available at this location.

If you are unable to attend Kickstart, please let us know so we can arrange another way to get you your kit.

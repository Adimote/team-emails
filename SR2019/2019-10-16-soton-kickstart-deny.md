Hello!

We regret to update you that the London kickstart venue is full, and so your team will not be able to go.

There is space for you at the Southampton venue, so we'd highly suggest going there instead. If Southampton is not viable for you, then we can arrange another way to get you your kit.

Please let Jake at [teams@] know which option you'd like, so we can make sure your kit gets to the right place.

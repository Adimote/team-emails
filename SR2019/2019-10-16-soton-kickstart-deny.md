Hello!


We regret to inform you that the London kickstart venue is full. There is space for you at the Southampton venue and we look forward to seeing you there instead.

If you are unable to get to Southampton, then we can arrange another way to get you your kit.

Please let Jake at [teams@] know which option you'd like, so we can make sure your kit gets to the right place.

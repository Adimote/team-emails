You're in! We're happy to confirm you've got a place at Student Robotics 2019! If you've applied for a second team, we sadly can't confirm you will receive a second kit until our deadline on the 26th.

The specific details for the London kickstart will be sent over soon to those who have requested the London venue. The London venue is small, and so we're only able to handle a small number of teams. Please only go to this venue if you've been confirmed. The Southampton venue (University of Southampton) will be available to all other teams.

To those who are unable to attend, worry not! Details on kit shipment will be coming through soon. The rules will be put live on the website during kickstart, so you won't miss out any planning time!

We look forward to seeing you there!

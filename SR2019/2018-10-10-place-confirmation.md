You're in! This email is a confirmation of your teams place at Student Robotics 2019. We are unable to confirm second teams until our deadline of the 26th, due to the space constraints of the venue.

The specific details for the London kickstart will be sent over soon to those who have requested the London venue. The Southampton venue (University of Southampton) will be available to all other teams.

We look forward to seeing you there!
